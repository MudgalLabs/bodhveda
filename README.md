```bash

  -d '{
    "to": { "recipient_id": "recipient_123", "channel": "posts", "topic": "post_id_123", "event": "new_comment" },
    "payload": { "title": "John commented on your post", "post_url": "url_to_post" }
  }'
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

            "title": "John commented on your post",

```

</details>

### 3. **Send a Broadcast Notification**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bodhveda.com/v1/notifications/send \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "payload": { "title": "Bodhveda v2 is live!", "message": "Check out what is new in our latest release." }
